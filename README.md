## What is a bank code

A bank code is a code assigned by a central bank, a bank supervisory body or a Bankers Association in a country to all its licensed member banks or financial institutions. The rules vary to a great extent between the countries.

In Denmark a 4-digit bank code is used (called Registreringsnummer, or Reg. nr.).
